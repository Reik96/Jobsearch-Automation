# Jobsearch-Automation


## Project Overview:

* Web scraping a website  
* Extracting important job facts 
* Using parameters for dynamic url
* Saving results in an excel sheet

## Introduction

In this project I used the BeautifoulSoup library to scratch jobs on a website. By entering the job parameters, the jobs are extracted and transferred to an Excel file. The table created in this way contains the job title, the company and the link to the job posting. It should be noted that some jobs (~ 2 to 3) are not extracted. These are sponsored job advertisements, which have a different structure than the normal ones.
